# MedianOddsRatioDOI10.1002-sim.8286
This repository contains the R code used for our manuscript in Statistics in Medicine DOI 10.1002/sim.8286 titled "Measuring variability between clusters by subgroup: An extension of the median odds ratio." 

Link to the manuscript: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.8286.

There is both an Rmarkdown (.rmd) and HTML version compiled from the Rmarkdown file. The HTML version is more readable if downloaded and opened with a browser.

This code is functional but not beautiful and benefits from the hard work of many more talented R programmers and their packages!
